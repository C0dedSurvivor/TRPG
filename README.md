Walk up to the test battle starter (the floating cubes) to start a battle <br />
Click on a player to select your moves (the 4 pills near the bottom of the battlefield) <br />
After all players move, enemies will move <br />
Battle continues until all of one team are dead

## Pause Menu:
Click on an option on the left gear to navigate to it
### Team:

### Skills:
Click on a number to see that tree <br />

## Known bugs:
* Enemies can walk through walls and end on impassable spaces
* Movement animations sometimes move length-first when they should be breadth-first and visa versa
* Jumping sometimes doesn't trigger properly
* Battles sometimes don't end correctly upon all enemies dying (has only happened once and has proved irrepeatable so far)
