## Known bugs:
* Leaving the window then coming back to it makes some UI textures no longer display
* Some jitter can occur when generating skill trees with horizontal scrolling
* Skill trees with vertical scrolling are not centered correctly and that can lead to some skills being partially or entirely off screen
* Visual indicators for attack range don't always work around walls
